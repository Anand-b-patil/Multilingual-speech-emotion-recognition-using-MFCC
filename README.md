## 📌 Project Overview

This project classifies emotions from speech audio samples across various languages. It extracts powerful acoustic features (MFCCs, Chroma, Mel Spectrograms) and applies both **machine learning** and **deep learning** models to recognize emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Multilingual support (English, Spanish, French, etc.)
* ✅ Emotion detection: **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Neutral**, etc.
* ✅ Advanced audio feature extraction using `Librosa`
* ✅ ML Models: SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost
* ✅ DL Models: CNN, LSTM, Transformers
* ✅ Scalable for **real-time** emotion detection applications
