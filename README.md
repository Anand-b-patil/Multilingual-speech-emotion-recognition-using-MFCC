🌍 Multilingual Speech Emotion Recognition 🎙️🧠
A machine learning and deep learning-based project for detecting emotions from speech across multiple languages using advanced audio processing techniques.

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying emotions from speech audio samples across multiple languages. It leverages key acoustic features and cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning models for multilingual emotion classification.

🚀 Features
✅ Supports multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish, French).
✅ Detects various emotions: happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.
✅ Utilizes MFCC, Chroma, and Mel Spectrograms for feature extraction.
✅ Implements CNN, LSTM, and Transformer-based deep learning models.
✅ Designed to be extensible for real-time emotion detection.

📂 Dataset
The project uses the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS), which contains speech samples from two female actors simulating different emotions while reading predefined sentences.
