🌍 Multilingual Speech Emotion Recognition 🎙️🧠
A machine learning project for detecting emotions from speech across multiple languages using advanced audio processing and deep learning techniques.

📌 Project Overview
This project classifies emotions from speech audio samples in multiple languages. It extracts key audio features and utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques for multilingual emotion classification.

🚀 Features
✅ Supports multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish, French, etc.).
✅ Classifies various emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral).
✅ Uses MFCC, Chroma, and Spectrograms for feature extraction.
✅ Implements CNN, LSTM, or Transformer-based models.
✅ Can be expanded for real-time emotion detection.

📂 Datasets
This project supports datasets like:

TESS (Toronto Emotional Speech Set) – English
RAVDESS – English
EMO-DB – German
CREMA-D – English
Other multilingual datasets (custom datasets can be added)
